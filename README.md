This is a project with base from https://github.com/JardinRyu/Jetson_Nano_People_Counting that I modify, customize and use and I make survey on it and its implementations and solutions, also some comments and functionalities added.
1. Feature for setting initial count of people in a room, so it does not start from 0 every time
2. Easy integration with IOT systems available as it returns current count of people in a room/space, using pahoMQTT it can be easily integrated in the inRoom additional method.
